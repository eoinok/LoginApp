# Login App

- This app builds on the previous google firebase app and uses firebase to register and login
- The App has multiple Screens

  # Step 1

  Get the app to work. Modify the settings in firebase.js using the settings from last week and get the app to register and authenticate users

  # Step 2

  Add an additional screen to the app that captures some info and records the data to firebase - this can be to a new collection of your choosing. Make sure there are at least two fields.
